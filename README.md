# Project Showcase

This project is a sophisticated, visually appealing webpage designed to effectively showcase the range of projects I have completed as a computer science student. The webpage embodies a dark theme, utilizing elegant design principles that ensure a tranquil and immersive user experience. The user interface seamlessly integrates subtle yet engaging animations, promoting a sense of calmness while maintaining a professional, polished aesthetic.

## Key Features & Layout

### Project Showcase Section

- Display twelve distinct project entries within a four-column grid, each encapsulated in a box. Each box features a project image, a concise heading (title), and a brief, one-sentence description that succinctly introduces the project.
- The layout maintains balance and visual harmony, with ample whitespace and careful alignment for a clean, modern look.

### Interactive Pop-Up for Project Details

- When a user clicks on any of the project boxes, an animated pop-up within the same page (without navigation or page refresh) smoothly transitions open.
- This pop-up reveals detailed information about the project, including an expanded description, images, screenshots, and relevant context such as the technologies used and the goals achieved. The pop-up also includes a visible and clickable link to the live project or its repository (e.g., GitHub, personal site).
- The animation for the pop-up is subtle and fluid, enhancing the user experience without being overwhelming.

### Overall Aesthetic and Design

- The dark theme is thoughtfully implemented, incorporating high-contrast typography and design elements that highlight the content while maintaining readability.
- Design principles like consistency, alignment, and proximity are used to create an organized and visually cohesive layout.
- Animations are smooth and non-distracting, designed to complement the userâ€™s interaction with the page rather than overshadow it.
- The webpage strikes a balance between innovation and functionality, creating a user-friendly and visually striking environment where visitors can explore my work in an intuitive and engaging manner.

## Animation Enhancements

To further enhance the user experience and create a more engaging and visually dynamic interface, the following sophisticated, stylish, and unique animations have been integrated:

### Entrance Animations for Project Boxes

- Project boxes now feature entrance animations using CSS keyframes for a fade-in and slide-up effect. This creates a smooth and visually appealing transition as the user scrolls through the projects.

### Enhanced Modal Pop-Up

- The modal pop-up for project details has been enhanced with a zoom-in animation and a background blur effect. This adds a layer of sophistication and focus to the detailed project view, making it more engaging for the user.

### Hover Animations for Project Images

- Project images now include hover animations with a slight rotation and scale effect. This interactive element adds a touch of playfulness and visual interest, encouraging users to explore the projects further.

These animation enhancements not only improve the visual appeal of the webpage but also contribute to a more immersive and enjoyable user experience. By balancing aesthetics with usability, the design stands out while maintaining functional and user-friendly interactions.

## Responsiveness Features

To ensure the webpage is responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across various devices, the following features have been implemented:

- Media queries have been added to `styles.css` to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
- The grid layout in `#project-showcase` changes to have fewer columns on smaller screens.
- Font sizes, padding, and margins are adjusted to ensure readability and proper spacing on various devices.

## New Functionalities

### Search Bar

A search bar has been added at the top of the project showcase section to allow users to search for specific projects.

### Filter Option
