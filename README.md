# Project Showcase

This project is a sophisticated, visually appealing webpage designed to effectively showcase the range of projects I have completed as a computer science student. The webpage embodies a dark theme, utilizing elegant design principles that ensure a tranquil and immersive user experience. The user interface seamlessly integrates subtle yet engaging animations, promoting a sense of calmness while maintaining a professional, polished aesthetic.

## Key Features & Layout

### Project Showcase Section

- Display three distinct project entries within a single row, each encapsulated in a box. Each box features a project image, a concise heading (title), and a brief, one-sentence description that succinctly introduces the project.
- The layout maintains balance and visual harmony, with ample whitespace and careful alignment for a clean, modern look.

### Interactive Pop-Up for Project Details

- When a user clicks on any of the project boxes, an animated pop-up within the same page (without navigation or page refresh) smoothly transitions open.
- This pop-up reveals detailed information about the project, including an expanded description, images, screenshots, and relevant context such as the technologies used and the goals achieved. The pop-up also includes a visible and clickable link to the live project or its repository (e.g., GitHub, personal site).
- The animation for the pop-up is subtle and fluid, enhancing the user experience without being overwhelming.

### Overall Aesthetic and Design

- The dark theme is thoughtfully implemented, incorporating high-contrast typography and design elements that highlight the content while maintaining readability.
- Design principles like consistency, alignment, and proximity are used to create an organized and visually cohesive layout.
- Animations are smooth and non-distracting, designed to complement the userâ€™s interaction with the page rather than overshadow it.
- The webpage strikes a balance between innovation and functionality, creating a user-friendly and visually striking environment where visitors can explore my work in an intuitive and engaging manner.
